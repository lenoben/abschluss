# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TEXT CLASSIFICATION AND MODEL COMPARISON WITH MLPACK C++

---

## COMMIT IN-DEPTH DESCRIPTION

- added my implementation of knn
- added [K-Nearest Neigbour KNN](./Model/ModelFlow/include/mein_knn.hpp)
- added [implementation of KNN](./Model/ModelFlow/src/mein_knn.cpp)


## Discussions and insights

- should i remove the Json Dataset private member from the Preprocessor class?
  > well i am not using RAM, just file system and it was there at first for holding the dataset in RAM _Bad idea_...

  _-removed-_
- I should remember to add error handling, but that will be later...
- I should remember to add doxygen comments
- Thinking whether to use sparse matrix or normal matrix; sparse matrix is more memory efficient but slower
  > Many functions arent supported with sparse matrix so normal matrix it is
  > Next is memory issues, hmmm
- would try savÄ±ng the matrÄ±xes Ä±n bÄ±nary format or csv
- modified [preprocessor combine method](./Model/ModelFlow/include/Preprocessing.hpp) to support collecting a specific file from the cloud
  > the file uri will be added later

- ### Currently building models

* Logistic regression
* Linear regression (possible)
* Linear SVM ðŸš«
* Random forest
* Naive bayes ðŸš«
* Self made KNN
* Self made nearest mean classifier NMC
* FFN

- ### Evaluation units
- Accuracy
- Precision
- F1 score
- Recall
- Support

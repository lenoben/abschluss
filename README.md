# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TEXT CLASSIFICATION AND MODEL COMPARISON WITH MLPACK C++

---

## COMMIT IN-DEPTH DESCRIPTION

- changed an overloaded constructor to take a string copy instead of a string reference [&list -->> list](./Model/ModelFlow/include/Preprocessing.hpp)
  > The reason is due to the fact that i want the list stored inside the class to be dependent from the outside list.
  > Enabling the user to reuse that list variable for something else.
- Added [Combine methods](./Model/ModelFlow/src/Preprocessing.cpp)
  > Still work in progress ðŸ§©
- Added [StringManipulation.hpp](./Model/ModelFlow/include/StringManipulation.hpp)
  > Contains methods/fucntions the preprocessor class will use to manipulate strings
- Added some documentations
